# 3D Maze AI Navigator

This project is a simplified educational tool for exploring maze generation and basic AI navigation in a 3D environment with Three.js. It is a static web application designed for hosting on GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser with WebGL support. Use the **Generate Maze** button to create a maze and **AI Step** to move the agent using a wall-following strategy.

## Folder Structure

- `css/` – Stylesheet
- `js/` – JavaScript modules
- `docs/` – Documentation

More advanced algorithms and features can be added following the modular structure provided.

# Sandbox

This repository contains a simple placeholder text adventure engine in the `game_engine` directory. Each file represents a major component of the architecture:

- `GameEngine.js`: central game loop and state container
- `InputParser.js`: basic command parser
- `ActionHandlers.js`: example action resolution functions
- `Display.js`: output/rendering helper
- `index.js`: connects the modules together
