## üìã **INCREMENTAL PR STRATEGY**

### **Recommended PR Approach: FEATURE-BASED INCREMENTAL PRS** ‚úÖ

**Answer**: YES, incremental PRs are recommended and should follow this strategy:

### **Branching Strategy for Autonomous Development**

```
main
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-4-core-features (main development branch)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-4.1-auth-screens (MERGED ‚úÖ)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-4.2-profile-management (READY FOR PR ‚úÖ)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-4.3-avatar-upload (NEXT)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-4.4-rbac (FUTURE)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-4.5-subscriptions (FUTURE)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task-4.6-biometric (FUTURE)
```

### **PR Frequency & Depth**
- **Task-level PRs**: Each task (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, etc.) should be a separate PR
- **Branch Depth**: Maximum 2 levels deep from main (main ‚Üí phase ‚Üí task)
- **PR Size**: 500-1500 lines per PR for optimal review
- **Integration Points**: Each task is a natural integration boundary

### **Benefits of This Approach**
‚úÖ **Incremental Review**: Easier code review in manageable chunks  
‚úÖ **Risk Mitigation**: Isolated features reduce integration risk  
‚úÖ **Rollback Safety**: Can rollback individual features if needed  
‚úÖ **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work on different tasks  
‚úÖ **Quality Gates**: Each PR includes testing and validation  

### **Technical Debt Considerations**
‚ùå **DEEPER BRANCHING CAUSES ISSUES**:
- Merge conflicts increase exponentially with depth
- Integration complexity grows with branch distance
- Testing becomes fragmented across branches
- Code review becomes difficult with deep context

‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED PRACTICE**:
- Keep branches 2 levels max from main
- Merge task branches quickly (within 1-2 days)
- Use feature flags for incomplete features
- Maintain continuous integration at task level

## üõë **CRITICAL STOP CONDITIONS**

### **When Development MUST Stop for Human Intervention**

1. **External Service Integration**
   - API keys or credentials needed
   - Third-party service setup required
   - Payment gateway configuration

2. **Infrastructure Decisions**
   - Database hosting selection
   - Production environment setup
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration

3. **Business Logic Clarification**
   - Unclear requirements in PRD
   - Missing business rules
   - User flow ambiguities

4. **Security Concerns**
   - Authentication strategy changes
   - Data privacy requirements
   - Security audit findings

### **Current Status: NO CRITICAL STOPS** ‚úÖ
All current tasks can be completed autonomously with mock implementations and placeholder integrations.

## üìù **AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT DIRECTIVE**

### **PRIMARY DIRECTIVE ACKNOWLEDGED** ‚úÖ

> **"Follow the action plan, develop per the PRD, and to the best extent practical, utilize technologies outlined in the tech stack. Always update the Action Plan with completion status, the readme with base user information, detailed report documents on a per phase basis, the deployment guide for human setup, and user guide for the front facing functions."**

### **Autonomous Development Protocol**

1. **Continue Development**: Implement all phases completely autonomously
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test each component and integration point
3. **Document Human Steps**: Create detailed setup guides for human follow-up
4. **Update Documentation**: Maintain all project documentation current
5. **Only Stop for Critical Issues**: Continue unless absolutely blocked

### **Documentation Maintenance Schedule**
- ‚úÖ **Action Plan**: Updated after each task completion
- ‚úÖ **README**: Updated with current status and setup instructions
- ‚úÖ **Phase Reports**: Detailed progress reports per phase
- ‚úÖ **Deployment Guide**: Human setup steps documented
- ‚úÖ **User Guide**: Front-facing functionality documented

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Task 4.3: Avatar Upload Implementation** (STARTING NOW)
- **Dependencies**: expo-image-picker, expo-file-system
- **Integration**: File upload utilities, image validation
- **Testing**: Mock file upload with real UI components
- **Documentation**: Avatar upload user guide

### **No Human Action Required**
- All dependencies can be installed autonomously
- Mock implementations will be used for external services
- Real integration points will be documented for human setup

### **Expected Completion Timeline**
- **Task 4.3**: 1-2 hours (Avatar upload functionality)
- **Task 4.4**: 1 hour (Role-based access control completion)
- **Task 4.5**: 2-3 hours (Subscription management system)
- **Task 4.6**: 1-2 hours (Biometric authentication framework)
- **Phase 4 Complete**: 5-8 hours total

## üìû **HUMAN FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS**

### **Immediate Actions (When You Return)**
1. **Review Task 4.2 PR**: Profile management implementation
2. **Test Profile Screens**: Verify functionality on device/simulator
3. **Approve/Merge**: Task 4.2 branch to phase-4-core-features

### **Setup Actions (After Phase 4 Complete)**
1. **External Services**:
   - Set up Cloudinary account for image storage
   - Configure Stripe for payment processing
   - Set up push notification services

2. **Infrastructure**:
   - Set up production database (Railway/Render)
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up app store developer accounts

3. **Testing**:
   - Run E2E tests on physical devices
   - Performance testing on various devices
   - User acceptance testing

### **Documentation Review**
- All documentation will be current and ready for review
- Deployment guides will include step-by-step instructions
- User guides will cover all implemented features
